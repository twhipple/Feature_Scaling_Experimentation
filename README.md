# Feature Scaling Experimentation


This notebook is where I hope to gain more insight into the world of standarization, normalization, and log transformations. I will create a list and then apply the following above in order to learn more about how the data changes and reacts to each method.

In the end I could see that Standardization and Normalization ended up not effecting the shapes of the data, only the x-axis  ranges were changed. Log Transformation had the greatest impact on the shape of the data.
